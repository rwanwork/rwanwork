## Welcome to my GitHub repository!

I'm a research associate at the University of Manchester in Prof. Patrick [Cai's](http://www.cailab.org/) laboratory of the Department of Chemistry.

You can find out more about me at my [homepage](http://www.rwanwork.info/), which probably needs some updating...
